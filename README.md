# D++
Dinh Anh's Programming Language
This is an intepreted, high-level programming language that is still WIP.
The language I use to interpret this is C++.
Currently, these are the features of this language:
- calculate
- create variable
- assign value
- input/output
- supports integers, characters, strings, booleans, lists
- you can assign all of the types of values above to a list
- supports parentheses
- supports comparisons
- supports functions
- supports for loops, while loops, if, else
# How to use this language
- create a text file named main.dpp
- compile the main_for_script.cpp file
- then type the command: ./main_for_script.exe main.dpp in terminal
- if you want to run and write the code using the main.cpp file, you have to type RUN for it to start running the code for you
# Language syntax
- comments are started with the '#' symbol
- spaces will be ignored, this language doesn't use indentations
- this also doesn't support semicolons, they're only used to separate parameters in the for loop
- array elements are accessed using square brackets, ```a[0]```
- curly brackets are used for function bodies
- function syntax:<br>
```func <function_name>(&<name if you want to pass by reference>, <name>)```<br>
```      <function body>```<br>
```}```<br>
- if statement syntax:<br>
```if(<parameter>){```<br>
```    <if statement body```<br>
```}```<br>
- for loop syntax:<br>
```for(<declaration>, <conditions>, <actions>){```<br>
```    <for loop body>```<br>
```}```<br>
- while loop syntax:<br>
```while(<condition>){```<br>
```    <while loop body>```<br>
```}```<br>
