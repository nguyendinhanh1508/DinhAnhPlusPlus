# D++
Dinh Anh's Programming Language
This is an intepreted, high-level programming language that is still WIP.
The language I use to interpret this is C++.
Currently, these are the features of this language:
- calculate
- create variable
- assign value
- input/output
- supports integers, characters, strings, booleans, lists
- you can assign all of the types of values above to a list
- supports parentheses
- supports comparisons
